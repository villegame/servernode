GunGame2 multiplayer server.
Project site: https://villegame.wordpress.com/projects/gungame2/

To set up a game server:

1. Run "git clone https://github.com/villegame/servernode.git" (if you use git bash)

2. Run "npm install" in servernode directory

3. Server listens to port 7777 on 127.0.0.1 by default, but you should change at least IP in index.js -file 'PORT LISTENER' section.

4. Run "nodejs index.js" or "node index.js" depending on which one you have and the server is running.
